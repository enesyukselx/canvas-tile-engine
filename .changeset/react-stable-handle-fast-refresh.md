Fix declarative children (notably `GridLines` and `DrawFunction`) disappearing after Fast Refresh.

`useCanvasTileEngine` built its handle with `useMemo`, which React treats as a discardable cache — Fast Refresh invalidates it, producing a new handle identity. That remounted the engine instance, and because child effects run before parent effects, every child's draw registration landed on a not-yet-created engine and was dropped. Components whose props changed identity afterwards (e.g. `items` arrays re-set by app effects) silently re-registered; components with only primitive or ref-held props (`GridLines`, `DrawFunction`) stayed blank.

The handle now lives in a `useRef`, guaranteeing one identity for the component's whole lifetime. As a side effect, editing app code no longer destroys and recreates the engine, so camera position and zoom survive Fast Refresh too.
