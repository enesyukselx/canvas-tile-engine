**BREAKING:** `style.lineWidth` and `radius` are now world units and scale with zoom, matching item geometry and Text's `size`/`fontPx` precedent (previously they were fixed screen pixels). Migration: keep old visuals with the new `lineWidthPx`; divide old radius values by your typical scale (e.g. `radius: 8` at scale 40 becomes `radius: 0.2`). GridLines keep their zoom-independent pixel width. This also makes Skia static-picture replay consistent with dynamic drawing instead of a documented quirk.

**New:** dashed Line/Path rendering via `LineStyle.lineDash` (world units, dashes anchored to the world) and `lineDashPx` (screen pixels). Follows Canvas2D `setLineDash` semantics; the pattern flows continuously around Path corners on every renderer (WebGL tessellates dashes on the CPU). Shared unit resolvers (`resolveLineWidthPx`, `resolveLineDashPx`, `resolveRadiusPx`) are exported from core.
